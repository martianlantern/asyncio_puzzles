Exercise 18: Shield and Finally - Critical Commit

OBJECTIVE:
Learn to use asyncio.shield() to protect critical operations from
cancellation, while still being cooperative around them.

TASK:
When a parent task is cancelled, a critical "commit" operation should
still complete. Use shield() to protect it, but understand the tradeoffs.

HINT: asyncio.shield(coro) protects the inner coroutine from cancellation
of the outer task, but the task can still be cancelled.
